# Copy this file to .env and update the values as needed:

# Flowise API key (Bearer token)
FLOWISE_API_KEY=your_flowise_api_key_here

# Flowise endpoint (default is http://localhost:3000)
FLOWISE_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000

# FastMCP Mode: Optionally set ONE or BOTH of these to lock in specific Chatflow or Assistant:
FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_ID=
FLOWISE_ASSISTANT_ID=

# LowLevel Mode: Dynamically expose tools for each chatflow/assistant
# Comma-separated list of chatflow IDs and their descriptions, e.g.:
# "chatflow_id:My \\"First\\" Chatflow,another_id:My Second Chatflow"
FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_DESCRIPTIONS=

# Optional filters for FastMCP Mode (ignored in LowLevel Mode):
# Whitelist: Comma-separated list of chatflow IDs to allow
FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_WHITELIST=
# Blacklist: Comma-separated list of chatflow IDs to deny
FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_BLACKLIST=

# Notes:
# - If neither FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_ID nor FLOWISE_ASSISTANT_ID is set:
#     - Exposes 'list_chatflows' and 'create_prediction(chatflow_id, question)'.
# - If exactly one is set:
#     - Exposes 'create_prediction(question)'.
# - If both are set:
#     - The server will refuse to start.
# - FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_DESCRIPTIONS is required for LowLevel Mode to dynamically expose tools.
